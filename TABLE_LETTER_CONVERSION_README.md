# Table Number Display System

## Overview
This system displays actual table numbers in the admin orders panel, making it easier to identify tables. For example:
- Table 1 → Table 1
- Table 2 → Table 2
- Table 3 → Table 3
- ...
- Table 26 → Table 26
- Table 27 → Table 27
- Table 28 → Table 28
- And so on...

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Modified Orders Model (`app/admin/models/Orders_model.php`)
- Modified `getOrderTypeNameAttribute()` method to lookup actual table names from database
- Removed letter conversion system to show real table names
- System now looks up table names from `ti_tables` table using the `table_id` stored in `order_type`

### 2. Fixed Order Creation Process
Updated multiple order creation endpoints to store actual table IDs instead of hardcoded "dine_in":
- `app/main/routes.php` - Main order creation
- `app/admin/routes.php` - Admin order creation  
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/OrderController.php` - API order creation
- `app/admin/controllers/Api/OrderController.php` - Admin API order creation

### 3. How It Works

#### Before (Problem):
- Orders were created with `order_type = 'dine_in'` (hardcoded)
- Admin panel showed "dine_in" for all table orders
- No way to identify which table the order came from

#### After (Solution):
- Orders are created with `order_type = table_id` (actual table ID)
- Admin panel looks up and displays actual table names from database
- Example: `order_type = "25"` displays as "Table 02" in admin (if table_id 25 has table_name "Table 02")

#### Display Logic:
```php
// System looks up table names from ti_tables table:
table_id 25 → "Table 02", table_id 26 → "Table 05", table_id 27 → "Table 03"
```

## Database Changes
No database schema changes were needed. The system works with existing data by:
- Using the existing `order_type` field to store table IDs
- Looking up actual table names from the `ti_tables` table when displaying in the admin panel

## Frontend Integration
The frontend already sends `table_id` when creating orders. The backend now properly stores this value instead of ignoring it.

## Testing
To test the system:
1. Create a new order from the frontend (e.g., from table 7)
2. Check the admin panel at `/admin/orders`
3. The order should show "Table G" instead of "dine_in"

## Benefits
1. **Clear Table Identification**: Staff can easily see which table orders came from
2. **Professional Appearance**: "Table A" looks better than "dine_in" or "7"
3. **Scalable**: System handles any number of tables (1→A, 100→CV, 1000→ALL)
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing orders continue to work

## Future Enhancements
- Could add table letter labels to physical tables
- Could integrate with table management system
- Could add table letter to receipts/invoices

## Files Modified
- `app/admin/models/Orders_model.php` - Core conversion logic
- `app/main/routes.php` - Order creation endpoint
- `app/admin/routes.php` - Admin order creation endpoint  
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/OrderController.php` - API order creation
- `app/admin/controllers/Api/OrderController.php` - Admin API order creation

## Notes
- The system automatically handles existing orders that may have "dine_in" as order_type
- New orders will immediately benefit from the letter conversion
- The conversion is purely cosmetic - table IDs are still stored as numbers in the database
